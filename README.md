# jitter
Practical and simplified version of jitter method based on [Harrison & Geman (2009) A rate and history-preserving resampling algorithm for neural spike trains. Neural Computation 21: 1244â€“58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3065177/)

The first application of this method to estimated jitter-corrected CCG of neural data can be found in:
[MA Smith, A Kohn (2008) Spatial and temporal scales of neuronal correlation in primary visual cortex. Journal of Neuroscience 28 (48), 12591-12603](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/48/12591)

See Figure 2 for an intuition of the method.

This code has been used to estimate Jitter-corrected CCG in the following papers:
[A Zandvakili, A Kohn. (2015) Coordinated neuronal activity enhances corticocortical communication. Neuron 87 (4), 827-839](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26291164/)

[X Jia, S Tanabe, A Kohn. (2013) Gamma and the coordination of spiking activity in early visual cortex. Neuron 77 (4), 762-774](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.12.036)
