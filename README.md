# jitter
Practical and simplified version of jitter method based on Harrison & Geman (2009) A rate and history-preserving resampling algorithm for neural spike trains. Neural Computation 21: 1244â€“58.

The first application of this method to estimated jitter-corrected CCG of neural data can be found in:
Spatial and temporal scales of neuronal correlation in primary visual cortex.
MA Smith, A Kohn.
Journal of Neuroscience 28 (48), 12591-12603
See Figure 2 for an intuition of the method.

This code has been used to estimate Jitter-corrected CCG in the following papers:

Gamma and the coordination of spiking activity in early visual cortex.
X Jia, S Tanabe, A Kohn.
Neuron 77 (4), 762-774

Coordinated neuronal activity enhances corticocortical communication.
