# jitter
Practical and simplified version of jitter method based on Harrison & Geman (2009) A rate and history-preserving resampling algorithm for neural spike trains. Neural Computation 21: 1244â€“58.

This code has been used to estimate Jitter-corrected CCG in the following papers:
Gamma and the coordination of spiking activity in early visual cortex
X Jia, S Tanabe, A Kohn
Neuron 77 (4), 762-774

Coordinated neuronal activity enhances corticocortical communication
